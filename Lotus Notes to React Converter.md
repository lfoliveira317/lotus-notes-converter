# Lotus Notes to React Converter

## Project Description

The **Lotus Notes to React Converter** is a powerful Python-based tool that modernizes legacy IBM Lotus Notes applications by converting them into contemporary React web applications. This project bridges the gap between outdated Notes infrastructure and modern web technologies, enabling organizations to preserve their valuable business logic while delivering a superior user experience.

## Problem Statement

Many enterprises still rely on IBM Lotus Notes applications built decades ago, facing several critical challenges:
